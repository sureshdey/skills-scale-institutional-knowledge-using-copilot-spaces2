# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation center. This comprehensive guide provides all the essential information about OctoAcme's project management processes, roles, and best practices.

## Project Management Overview

OctoAcme utilizes a structured project management methodology that covers initiation, planning, execution, risk management, release, and continuous improvement. Each process is defined in an individual document within this folder. The intent is to enable consistent project delivery, clear roles, effective risk communication, and rapid learning from retrospectives.

### Key Principles
- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning

### Core Roles
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs and approvals

### Project Lifecycle
1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, stakeholders, and high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Establish scope, resources, milestones, and dependencies
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate
4. **Release**: Deploy, verify, and announce
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings and identify next steps
